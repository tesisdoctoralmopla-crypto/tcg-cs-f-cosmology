## Abstract

**TCG-CS-F: Unified theory resolving the Double Crisis (Quantum/Cosmology) by unifying Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) into a single scalar field ($\chi$). It predicts a Decoherence Cliff ($\mathbf{M_{cr} \approx 10^9 \text{ amu}}$) and a spectral signal ($\mathbf{f = 96.7 \text{ MHz}}$), satisfying the rigorous criteria for an Underlying Theory.**

## Model: TCG-CS-F (Canonical Theory of Gravity with Physical Screening Field)

The paper proposes the **TCG-CS-F** framework as the **Underlying Theory** necessitated by critiques of standard cosmology (Coley and Ellis). Its core **economy** is achieved by replacing the two dark sectors (DM and DE) and the quantum measurement postulate with a single scalar field, fixed by **one new fundamental constant** ($\mathbf{\beta = 8.3 \times 10^{-5}}$).

### Key Falsifiable Predictions (**Double Front of Falsifiability**)

The model's rigor is tested through three core predictions:

* **1. Quantum Front (Decoherence Cliff):** Prediction of an abrupt loss of quantum coherence at a critical mass of $\mathbf{M_{cr} \approx 10^9 \text{ amu}}$.
* **2. Cosmological Front (DM/DE Signature):** Prediction of a unified Dark Sector signal detectable at a precise frequency: $\mathbf{f_{res} = 96.7 \text{ MHz}}$.
* **3. Gravitational Front (Extreme Comet Test):** Prediction of orbital deviations for test objects in the ultra-low density region of the Solar System (beyond $\mathbf{q=0.1 \text{ au}}$), where the **PPN screening mechanism** breaks down.
